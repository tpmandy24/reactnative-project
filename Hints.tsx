/* This file contains a walkthrough of how Promises & Async/Await work in practice.
   This will most likely be very helpful for MP 3A.

   Here's what you should do â€“

    1. First, read this high-level overview of networking in React Native. This example
        involves making a network request to download a list of movies from a remote JSON source
        and using it in state. Pay close attention to how the async/await keywords are used.

        https://reactnative.dev/docs/network

    2. After reading that, I'd recommend skimming over how promises work. 

        Promises in 100 Seconds:

    3. Now, you're ready to dive into the example in this file. If needed, reference the Firebase documentation:
    
       Uploading Images to Cloud Storage:
        https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/upload-files#upload_from_a_blob_or_file

       Adding a Document to Cloud Firestore:
        https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#set_a_document

       ...but everything you need to write your social object to Firestore should be in this file
       ...reminder: make sure to use async/await, and not the nested promises approach!

// This is the verbose, old way of doing things
// Aniruth's note: This is the Firebase v8 way of doing things. It's not what we are using.

  getFileObjectAsync(eventImage).then((object) => {

// Aniruth's Note: This is the Firebase v9 way of doing things.

// Make sure you read through the Firebase documentation to understand what's going on and what's missing.

const thePlaceWhereWeUseIt = () => {
  // If we have promises/callbacks within a function,
  // the function will return immediately, and our code that lies
  // within those callbacks will execute at some point later.
  regularNetworkRequests();

  // If we declare a function as async/await, then the function will
  // return a promise. We can either choose to ignore it, or we can
  // explicitly deal with the promise if we want to be notified
  // when it succeeds or fails.

  // Option A: Ignore the promise. When we want to put this sort
  // of request in a button onPress method, we can usually just do
  // this.
  asyncAwaitNetworkRequests();

  // Option B: Handle the promise.
